### /etc/passwd vs /etc/shadow
The major difference is that they contain different pieces of data.
- passwd contains the users' public information (UID, full name, home directory) => readable by everyone,
```sh 
google:x:1000:1000:google search:/home/google:/bin/bash
```
- while shadow contains the hashed password and the password expiry data. => readable by root
```sh
amazon:$6$GjtgpLxdaueFJfiCRlZpg3qYTGjp.:18868:0:99999:7:::
```
> Note: The /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files are linked/connected together by the user ID (UID) field.

# MOUNT FILE System 
To mount a filesystem in Linux, you can use the mount command. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify the device

Use the lsblk or fdisk -l command to identify the device you want to mount. For example:

> lsblk

This will display all block devices connected to the system.

2. Create a mount point

Create a directory where you will mount the filesystem. For example:

> sudo mkdir /mnt/mydrive

3. Mount the filesystem

Use the mount command to mount the device to the directory. Replace <device> with the device name (e.g., /dev/sdb1) and <mount_point> with the directory you created:

> sudo mount <device> <mount_point>

Example:

> sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive

4. Verify the mount

Check if the device is mounted using:

> df -h

or

> mount | grep /mnt/mydrive

5. (Optional) Update /etc/fstab for persistent mounting

To automatically mount the device at boot, edit the /etc/fstab file:

> sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add an entry in the following format:

> /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive ext4 defaults 0 0

Replace /dev/sdb1 with your device, /mnt/mydrive with your mount point, and ext4 with the filesystem type.

6. Unmounting the filesystem

When done, unmount the device using:

> sudo umount <mount_point>

Example:

sudo umount /mnt/mydrive

### FILE SYSTEM 
Good question! Specifying the filesystem type (ext4, ntfs, xfs, etc.) is optional in many cases because the mount command can automatically detect it. However, there are situations where explicitly specifying the filesystem type is necessary:

When you might need to specify the filesystem type:

1. Unsupported or uncommon filesystems: If the kernel or mount cannot automatically detect the type, you'll need to specify it.


2. Forcing a specific type: If the device has multiple partitions or metadata confusing the auto-detection.


3. Mounting non-standard filesystems: For example, mounting a Windows NTFS drive or a FAT32 USB drive.


4. If auto-detection fails: Sometimes, the system might not correctly identify the filesystem, especially with corrupted or unusual partitions.



How to specify the filesystem type:

Use the -t option in the mount command to specify the filesystem type explicitly:

> sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive

How to determine the filesystem type:

Use the blkid command or lsblk -f to identify the filesystem type:

> sudo blkid /dev/sdb1

or

> lsblk -f

Example Scenarios:

1. Ext4 filesystem:

> sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive


2. NTFS filesystem (commonly used in Windows):

sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive


3. FAT32 filesystem (for USB drives):

> sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive



If youâ€™re unsure of the type, using blkid or lsblk -f beforehand helps avoid errors.
