## ITIL & ITSM Change Management: A Complete Guide for Support Engineers

**Change management** (now called "Change Enablement" in ITIL 4) is a core IT Service Management (ITSM) practice designed to ensure that changes to IT systems and services are made in a controlled, efficient, and low-risk manner[1][2][6]. As a support engineer, understanding this process is essential, as youâ€™ll often interact with it when troubleshooting, implementing, or supporting IT changes.

## Key Definitions

- **Change**: Any addition, modification, or removal of anything that could affect IT services. This includes software, hardware, processes, documentation, or supplier interfaces[1][2][6].
- **Change Management/Enablement**: The practice of controlling the lifecycle of all changes to minimize risk and disruption while maximizing benefits[1][2].
- **Request for Change (RFC)**: A formal proposal for a change, usually submitted via a structured form[5][6].
- **Change Advisory Board (CAB)**: A group of stakeholders who assess, prioritize, and authorize significant changes[1][4].
- **Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB)**: A smaller, agile version of the CAB, convened for urgent changes[1].
- **Change Manager**: The person responsible for overseeing the change management process[1][5].
- **Change Schedule (Forward Schedule of Change)**: A calendar of approved, planned changes to avoid conflicts and ensure coordination[6].

## Types of Changes

| Type         | Description                                                                 | Example                                    | Approval Process        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Standard     | Pre-authorized, low-risk, routine changes                                   | Password resets, software patching         | Pre-approved           |
| Normal       | All other changes, assessed for risk, can be minor, significant, or major   | Server upgrade, new application deployment | CAB/Manager approval   |
| Emergency    | Urgent changes needed to resolve major incidents or vulnerabilities         | Security patch for zero-day exploit        | ECAB, expedited review |

| Normal - Minor | Low to Medium   | Change Manager        | Small config changes                   |
| Normal - Major | High            | CAB/IT Management     | System migrations, new service rollout |
| Emergency      | High/Urgent     | ECAB (Emergency CAB)  | Outage fixes, urgent security patches  |

## The ITIL Change Management Process

The process is structured into several stages, each serving a specific purpose to ensure changes are managed effectively[4][5][6][9]:

### 1. **Change Initiation (RFC Submission)**
- Anyone can propose a change by submitting an RFC.
- The RFC must detail the change, its purpose, affected systems, risk assessment, and rollback plan[5][6].

### 2. **Change Categorization and Prioritization**
- The RFC is categorized (standard, normal, emergency) and prioritized based on urgency and impact.
- This determines the approval workflow and resource allocation[4][5].

### 3. **Change Assessment**
- The change is reviewed for feasibility, risks, and potential impact.
- For significant changes, the CAB is involved; for minor ones, the Change Manager may decide[1][4].

### 4. **Change Approval**
- The appropriate authority (Manager, CAB, ECAB) formally approves or rejects the change.
- Emergency changes follow a fast-tracked process[1][4][6].

### 5. **Change Planning & Scheduling**
- Approved changes are planned in detail, including timelines, responsibilities, and communication.
- Scheduling ensures no conflicts with other changes and that resources are available[5][6].

### 6. **Change Implementation**
- The change is executed according to the plan, with all stakeholders informed.
- Implementation may be led by the release manager or technical teams[5].

### 7. **Change Review & Closure**
- After implementation, a post-implementation review checks if objectives were met and identifies lessons learned.
- The change is formally closed in the system, and documentation is updated[4][6][9].

### 8. **Continuous Improvement**
- Feedback and data from reviews are used to refine future change management processes[4].

## Related Terms and Concepts

- **Change Control**: The process of managing changes to ensure they are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner[9].
- **Change Model**: A predefined process for handling specific types of changes, especially standard ones[1].
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of potential issues arising from the change[2][4].
- **Rollback Plan**: A documented procedure to revert the change if it fails or causes issues[5].
- **Change Calendar**: A shared schedule showing all upcoming changes to avoid resource or service conflicts[6].

## Why Change Management Matters

- **Reduces risk**: Prevents unplanned outages and service disruptions.
- **Ensures compliance**: Maintains audit trails for regulatory requirements[2].
- **Improves communication**: Keeps all stakeholders informed and engaged.
- **Supports continuous improvement**: Lessons learned drive better practices over time[4].

## As a Support Engineer, You Should:

- Understand how to submit and track RFCs.
- Know the difference between standard, normal, and emergency changes.
- Be familiar with the change schedule and how it might impact your work.
- Participate in post-implementation reviews when relevant.
- Communicate effectively with change managers and CAB members.
