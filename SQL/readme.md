i would say they are similar but not the same, lemme say you why

- Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service. Great for cloud-native applications. Provides a scalable and flexible database platform. Perfect for scenarios where you want to fully control and scale your databases independently.

- Azure SQL Managed Instance Iis also a fully managed relational database service, but with a twist. Designed to make the migration of on-premises SQL Server databases super smooth. Gives you more control over instance-level features, mimicking the on-premises SQL Server experience. Ideal for lift-and-shift scenarios where you want a near 100% compatibility with your existing SQL Server apps.
- so PaaS (automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high availability) + native daily use SQL Server Features
# SQL Elastic Pool

> ideal example is :
There are large differences between peak utilization and average utilization per database. ✅
The peak utilization for each database occurs at different points in time.✅
eDTUs are shared between many databases

Azure SQL Database elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases with varying and unpredictable usage demands

The amount of resources available to the pool is controlled by your budget. All you have to do is:
- Add databases to the pool.
- Optionally set the minimum and maximum resources for the databases, in either DTU or vCore purchasing model.
- Set the resources of the pool based on your budget.
> When you move databases into or out of an elastic pool, there's no downtime except for a brief period (on the order of seconds) when database connections are dropped at the end of the operation.
